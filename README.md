# Automated Trading Strategy in MetaTrader 5

This repository contains a Python script designed to automate trading in MetaTrader 5 (MT5) using strategies based on technical signals, market analysis, and risk management. It includes functionalities to open and close trades and manage the connection with MetaTrader 5.

---

## Key Features

- **Order execution** based on buy/sell signals using market book data and customizable slippage.
- **Trade management** with dynamic stop loss (SL) and take profit (TP).
- **Automatic trade closing** when certain technical conditions (e.g., RSI levels) are met.
- **Daily loss management**: the script halts trading if a configurable daily loss threshold is reached.
- **Automated scheduling** of trades using `apscheduler`, aligned with market session times.

---

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8 or higher**
- **MetaTrader 5 installed** and access to an active trading account.
- Required Python libraries (install using `pip`):
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

Initial Setup
1. Connect to MetaTrader 5

    Before running the script, ensure that your MetaTrader 5 account is properly configured.
    Set up the symbols to trade in the configuration file symbol_config.

2. Configuration File (symbol_config)

The configuration file defines specific parameters for each trading symbol. Customize the following parameters:

symbol_config = {
    "EURUSD": {
        "max_spread": 0.00015,
        "TPSLRatio_coef": 1.5,
        "rsi_overbought": 70,
        "rsi_oversold": 30
    },
    "AUDNZD": {
        "max_spread": 0.00020,
        "TPSLRatio_coef": 2.0,
        "rsi_overbought": 75,
        "rsi_oversold": 25
    },
    # Add other symbols as needed
}

3. Scheduler Configuration

The script uses apscheduler to schedule trades based on market hours. Trades are executed:

    Sunday to Friday, at minute intervals defined in the code.
    Friday 21:30: All open positions are closed.

Script Workflow Explanation

    Initialization:
        Connects to MetaTrader 5.
        Checks account status.

    Trading Cycle:
        Fetches OHLC data and technical signals.
        Calculates key parameters like position size, stop loss, and take profit.
        Executes trades if conditions are met.
        Closes positions based on RSI or predefined thresholds.

    Risk Management:
        Monitors daily losses and halts trading if the threshold is reached.

    Position Closing:
        Automatically closes all open positions at the end of Friday's trading session.

Log Files

The system records important information for analysis in the following files:

    trading_log.txt: General information about executed trades.
    error_log.txt: Errors captured during the trading process.
